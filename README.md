Hello world! I´m Paula Majul  🙋‍♀️. 
I´ve recently graduated and got my bachelor´s degree in Economics.

When I graduated college I felt pretty lost about what I wanted to do with my carrer, as most of us I think, 
so I took an Data Analytics course and learned a lot about SQL and PowerBI (DAX and M language). 
I found a new passion there, the "Data World" really got me. 
Now I´m studying Python to move forward on Data Science 💞️.

I´ve made this portfolio in order to show my potential creating PowerBi dashboards!
